In FREIA the bakeout system is connected to Delta IFD9506 server "192.168.1.104:2020"

The example BOY opi file is included in opi/helper-opi-files. Define macro P 
to the same value as DT320PREFIX argument in your startup script:

iocsh -r ioc-bakeout-freia,<ver> -c 'requireSnippet(bakeout-freia.cmd, "IP_ADDR=192.168.1.104:2020, DT320PREFIX=")'
