WAVEFORM record DOES NOT WORK YET

To use the module in an ioc add the following statements to your startup snipppet:

require bakeout-freia,<version>
epicsEnvSet("BAKEOUT_PORT-1", "<YOUR-ASYN-PORT-1>")

drvAsynIPPortConfigure(${BAKEOUT_PORT-1}, <ip-addr:port>,0,0,0)

## Load record instances
dbLoadRecords("bakeout.db","DT320_PORT=${BAKEOUT_PORT-1},PREFIX='<pv-prefix>'")

In FREIA the bakeout system is connected to Delta IFD9506 server "192.168.1.104:2020"

The example BOY opi file is included in opi/helper-opi-files. Define macro P 
to the same value as <pv-prefix> in your startup script.
